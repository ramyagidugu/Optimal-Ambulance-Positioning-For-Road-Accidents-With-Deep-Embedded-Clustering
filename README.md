# Optimal-Ambulance-Positioning-For-Road-Accidents-With-Deep-Embedded-Clustering
Road accidents lead to significant loss of life, often due to delayed emergency response. This project uses Deep Embedded Clustering to analyze accident, road, and weather data, identifying high-risk zones for optimal ambulance placement and faster response times.
